# Algorithms challenges
This repository contains my solutions for algorithms challenges from various levels. All of them are in JavaScript or TypeScript.

Challenges come from Codewars, Edabit, Binarysearch, Daily Coding Problem newsletter and many other places - I'm being creative with searching something challenging for me. 

I also try my first steps with Jest by writing my own tests to algorithms :)
